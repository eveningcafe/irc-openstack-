[14:17] <ifat_afek> hoango___: hi
[14:17] <hoango___> yes?
[14:17] <ifat_afek> regarding Mistral: the link that you sent does not include the right example, I think. Please look here:  https://docs.openstack.org/vitrage/latest/contributor/vitrage-templates.html
[14:17] <ifat_afek> Look for the example with get_attr(), I believe this is what you need
[14:18] <hoango___> oh
[14:18] <hoango___> but is function in queens version?
[14:19] <ifat_afek> Let me know if you think it could work. And Iâ€™ll update the documentation in mistral-config link
[14:19] <hoango___> i have vitrage in queens version. can i do get_attr () ?
[14:19] <ifat_afek> Yes, it is implemented in Queens
[14:20] <ifat_afek> but you must use Vitrage template version 2
[14:20] <hoango___> thanks. i will try this.
[14:20] <ifat_afek> ok, let us know if you have other issues
[14:21] <hoango___> can i contract with u by email?
[14:26] <ifat_afek> hoango___: of course. you can email me directly ifat.afek@nokia.com, or use the openstack-discuss mailing list with a [vitrage] tag in the title
